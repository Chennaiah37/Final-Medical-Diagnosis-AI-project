ðŸ©º Project Description â€“ Rule-Based AI Medical Diagnosis
This project presents a simple, rule-based AI system for medical diagnosis based on user-input symptoms. Unlike data-driven machine learning approaches, this system uses manually defined rules that map symptoms to diseases. Upon receiving symptoms, the system compares them to its internal knowledge base and identifies the most probable conditions. It also suggests the appropriate medical specialist for consultation. The output is displayed in a clean, color-coded format to enhance readability and user experience, with support for both interactive and demo modes.
